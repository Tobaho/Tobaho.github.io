Semester goals
This semester, i hope to learn everything that has to do with data visualization. 
I have been trying to take a tableu/ data visualization course on udemy, but they were too expensive for me to afford. 
I am hoping to learn the important programming languages in this class. 
I am so excited that i get to take this class this semster. I am hoping i will get all the knowledge i need in my data science career.
