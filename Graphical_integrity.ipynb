        "This presentation displayed graphical excellence. The post was clear, detailed and the graphics did not qoute data out of text. The writers aim was to show how wedding venues use instagram to attract brides. She made a graph comparing thhese venues and the likes it recieved. This graph, i believe demonstrated graphical excellence. Though this graph displayed graphical excellence, i think there should have been a comparison betwween a lot of venues and not juding based on three. "

We can't exactly tell the demographics from the pie chart. "
